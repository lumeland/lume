## [Unreleased]
### Added
- New `-w, --watch` option to watch changes without starting a web server. [#109]

### Changed
- Render pages in parallel, reducing the build time for large sites.

### Fixed
- The async cache for `inline` plugin.
- Some preprocessors were executed several times. [#110]

## [0.23.3] - 2021-06-21
### Added
- New metrics feature that allows measuring the performance of large sites:
  Use `lume --metrics` to show the metrics in the CLI
  or `lume --metrics=filename.json` to save the data in a file.
  You can also configure it in the config file.
- New `--verbose` option to configure the level of details logged:
  - `0`: only important things
  - `1`: normal details (the default option)
  - `2`: high details (for debugging purposes)
- Allow extensions on Nunjucks. [#108]

### Fixed
- Improved the way CLI arguments are applied to the site instance.
- Ensure duplicated pages have an unique `src.path` value.
- The `relative_urls` plugin should ignore data URLs. [#107]

## [0.23.2] - 2021-06-19
### Fixed
- Relative URL resolution. [#105]

## [0.23.1] - 2021-06-17
### Fixed
- Error when using `search.pages()` without arguments.

## [0.23.0] - 2021-06-17
### Added
- New `slugify_urls` plugin.
- Support for quotes to `page.search()`.
  This allows to insert spaces in the values.
  For example: `page.search("'tag with spaces' title='Title with spaces'")`.

### Changed
- BREAKING: The URLs of the pages will no longer be slugified by default.
  Use the `slugify_urls` plugin.
- The plugin `attributes` is disabled by default.

### Removed
- The `slugifyUrls` option. Use the `slugify_urls` plugin for that.
- Support for objects in the `url` variable.

### Fixed
- Replaced the `terser` dependency with a Deno version.
- Updated `std` and `postcss`.

## [0.22.6] - 2021-06-15
### Added
- Events `afterRender` and `beforeSave`.
- New method `site.addHelper()` to register different types of helpers.

### Changed
- The class signature of template engines:
  replaced the `addFilter` method with more generic `addHelper`
  that allows to register not only filters but also custom tags
  and other features supported by some engines, like Nunjucks.

### Removed
- The experimental plugin `image`. Moved to another repository.

### Fixed
- Bug in the function to merge default and user options.
- Ensure the `Page` and `Directory` classes always have the `src` object.
- Updated `postcss` and `eta`.

## [0.22.5] - 2021-06-10
### Added
- Argument `limit` to `search.pages()`.

### Fixed
- Bug on overriding the URL with `--location`.

## [0.22.4] - 2021-06-09
### Added
- Display a warning when installing Lume with an old Deno version.

### Fixed
- Updated `std`.
- Updated `postcss` to support Deno 1.11.0.

## [0.22.3] - 2021-06-07
### Fixed
- Bug in the import map after upgrading to 0.22.2.

## [0.22.2] - 2021-06-07
### Added
- `deno run <script>` accepts several scripts at the same time.
- Display the name of a script executed by `deno run <script>`.

### Changed
- The CLI options are applied before `lume()` returns the site instance.
  This allows to access these options in `_config.js`.
  For example, after running `lume --dev`,
  you can include conditions in the `_config.js` file like this:

  ```js
  const site = lume();

  if (site.options.dev) {
    // Development stuff
  }
  ```

  Previously,
  these overrides were applied after `_config.js` exports the site instance.

### Fixed
- Improved the performance of loading page layouts by using the `Source` cache.
- Improved error reporting.
- `search.pages()` with no arguments
  returns pages with other extensions than `.html`.
- Clear the cache before building.
  This allows to run several builds in the same script.
- Updated `nunjucks` (a new fork) and `highlight.js`.

## [0.22.1] - 2021-06-05
### Fixed
- The file `ci.js` and the command `lume init` on Windows.

## [0.22.0] - 2021-06-04
### Added
- New plugin `base_path` to automatically search and fix all URLs in the HTML
  by adding the path prefix of the `location` option.
  This reduces the need to use the `url` filter everywhere.
- The `search.pages()` helper allows multiple values to sort by.

### Changed
- BREAKING: The `url` variable of the pages must start with `/`, `./` or `../`.
- Uncoupled the loaders. Now they only need the path argument.
- Preprocessors check the extension of the input and output file.
  (Previously only the output extension was used.)

### Fixed
- The `url` filter shouldn’t add the path prefix if it’s already added.
- `search.pages()` must return only HTML pages.
  (Previously, it also returned assets.)
- Windows installation. [#98]

## [0.21.1] - 2021-06-03
### Fixed
- Restored `import_map.json` to not break upgrades from older versions.

## [0.21.0] - 2021-06-01
### Added
- The `postcss` and `terser` filters. [#97]
- The `--plugins` argument to `lume init`, so you can load and use plugins.
  Example: `lume init --plugins=postcss,terser,pug`.
- The property `document` to `Page` that returns the parsed HTML.
- New plugin `code_highlight` to automatically highlight all code
  inside `pre code`. Previously, it was part of the Markdown plugin.
  Now it’s uncoupled, so it can be used by any template engine.
- The `extensions` and `attribute` options to the `inline` plugin.
- New argument `--dev` (or `-d`) for `lume upgrade`
  to upgrade to the latest development version.

### Changed
- Nunjucks no longer loads `.html` files by default.
- The loader argument in `loadPages` and `loadAssets` is now optional,
  and the text loader is used by default.
- The loaders and template engines are now fully decoupled.
  This allows to use the variable `templateEngine` in a layout.
- BREAKING: Removed automatic code highlighting from the Markdown plugin.
  Use the new `code_highlight` plugin.
- Moved the client code of live reload to a external file `ws.js`.
- Live server reloads the entire HTML page after JavaScript changes.

### Removed
- The `.markdown` extension.
  Use `.md` or configure the Markdown plugin to enable it.
- The function `site.engine()`. Use the third argument of `site.loadPages()`.
  For example: `site.loadPages([".html"], textLoader, nunjucksEngine)`.
- The plugin `dom`.
  It’s no longer needed because pages can easily return the parsed HTML.
  For example: `site.process([".html"], (page) => modify(page.document))`.

### Fixed
- Updated `std`, `postcss`, `deno_dom`, `date_fns`
  and `highlight.js` (to `11.x`).

## [0.20.2] - 2021-05-18
### Added
- More default character replacements to slugifier.

### Changed
- Simplified the script runner
  by using the `/bin/bash` or `PowerShell.exe` executable.
  This adds support for more features, like pipes, etc.

### Fixed
- Updated `pug`.
- Resolve the imported files from template engines, like `nunjucks`,
  when the `src` is in a subdirectory.

## [0.20.1] - 2021-05-15
### Added
- File `install.js` for easy installation.

### Removed
- The command `install` from the CLI.

### Fixed
- The Lume version.

## [0.20.0] - 2021-05-14
### Added
- New properties `pretty` and `slugify` for the `url` page variable
  to override the corresponding `prettyUrls` and `slugifyUrls` site options
  in particular pages. [#95]
- `import_map.json` to the installation process. This allows to import Lume
  in the `_config.js` file with `import lume from "lume/mod.js";`.
- New command `lume install` to install Lume easily using the import map.
- New script `ci.js` to execute the CLI in a CI environment
  (without installing it or defining the import map).
- New argument `--import-map` for the `lume init` command
  to enable or disable the import map in the `_config.js` file.
  By default, it’s enabled.

### Changed
- The minimum Deno version supported to `1.10.0`.
- BREAKING: `prettyUrls` to not apply to the `url` page variable
  if it’s a string. To generate a custom pretty URL: [#95]
  - use an object (e.g., `{ path: /about-me }`)
  - add a trailing slash (e.g., `/about-me/`)
  - use a full URL (e.g., `/about-me/index.html`).
- BREAKING: `url` values to not assume that the page is HTML.
  This means the `.html` extension won’t be added by default. [#95]
- `lume init` to generate a `_config.js` file using the import map.
  Use `lume init --import-map=false` to use the old URLs.

### Removed
- The property `ext` from the `url` page variable,
  because `path` now includes it. [#95]
- The command `lume update`. It’s not needed thanks to import maps.

### Fixed
- Updated the `std` dependency.

## [0.19.0] - 2021-05-10
### Added
- The `url` page variable supports an object with `path` and `ext` properties
  to fully customize the output filename. [#83]
- New plugin `relative_urls` to convert all URLs to relative. [#85]
- Preprocessors (like processors, but are executed before rendering). [#91]
- Allowed setting options for the Nunjucks plugin. [#90]
- Options to customize the `slugifyUrls` setting: [#94]
  - `lowercase`: to enable/disable lowercase conversion (`true` by default)
  - `alphanumeric`: to convert all characters to ASCII (`true` by default)
  - `separator`: to customize the separator (`-` by default)
  - `replace`: an object to replace some special characters.
- Option `includes` to customize the path (or paths)
  used to resolve the `@import`ed files in the `postcss` plugin.
  Use `includes: false` to disable it.
- `autoprefixer` is included by default in the `postcss` plugin.

### Changed
- The default URL of the `paginate` helper to relative: `./page-${page}`.
- Improved the slugifier to handle the separator better, for example:
  - `200,000*7` becomes `200-000-7` and not `2000007`
  - `!2 / 3%` becomes `2/3` and not `-2-/-3-`
  - `Who is?.txt` becomes `who-is.txt` and not `who-is-.txt`.

### Removed
- The deprecated `permalink` variable in pages. Use `url` instead.

### Fixed
- Ignored files on server update weren’t detected properly. [#88]
- Throw an error when a proper template engine can’t be found. [#87]
- Missing doctype after DOM manipulation.
- The `njk` filter didn’t work with async filters. [#93]
- Fixed support for subextensions (like `page.html.md`). [#83]
- Improved the errors of the `inline` plugin.
- Made sure that all characters are lowercased when slugifying
  (so “№” becomes `no` and not `No`).
- Relative URL syntax to require the prefix `./` or `../`,
  so URLs like `.foo`, `..foo` or `.../foo` are interpreted correctly.
- Changes in `_data/*/*` files weren’t updated correctly on `--serve`.
- Updated the `postcss` and `postcss_import` dependencies.

## [0.18.1] - 2021-04-26
### Fixed
- Creation of `Date` values. [#82]
- Updated the `postcss` and `terser` dependencies. [#81]

## [0.18.0] - 2021-04-24
### Added
- A second argument for the `lume()` function
  to configure the default plugins. [#45]
- Support for more file formats on local server. [#67]

### Changed
- API for the `search` helper: [#69]
  - Replaced the operator `~=` with `*=`.
  - Added the `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` operators.
  - Allowed using the `OR` operator with pipes,
    like `tag1|tag2` or `title=value1|value2`.
  - Added support for numeric values.
  - Added support for date and datetime values.
- The `date("ATOM")` filter uses `Z` instead of `+00:00`. [#64]
- Removed the `hljs` class from the blocks of unhighlighted code. [#71]
- Datetime values in filenames can omit the seconds,
  like in `2021-04-24-18-00_post.md`.

### Fixed

- Changed some filenames to align with the Deno style guide. [#73]
- Updated dependencies. [#63], [#70], [#72], [#76], [#79]

## [0.17.1] - 2021-04-14
### Added
- New option `-o`/`--open` to open the browser automatically
  when running `lume --serve`. [#62]

### Removed
- The extensions `.html.js` and `.html.ts` introduced in 0.17.0.
  They can be confusing because not all templates must generate HTML pages,
  so `.tmpl.js`/`.tmpl.ts` are more agnostic and fit all cases.

### Fixed
- Updated the `postcss` version to fix source maps.
- Updated the `postcss_import` version to fix the `@charset` at-rule.

## [0.17.0] - 2021-04-11
### Added
- The local IP address is shown on `lume --serve`. [#55]
- Allowed an empty front matter. [#54]

  (in order to replace to `.tmpl.js` and `.tmpl.ts`
  that will be removed in the future).
- Added ability to change the sort direction in `search`. [#57]

### Changed
- Deprecated the `permalink` page variable. Use `url` instead. [#46]
- Removed the `permalink` variable in the `paginate` helper that uses `sprintf`.
  Now it accepts only the `url` option that must be a function.

### Fixed
- Improved the slugifier, including a better support for Unicode. [#50], [#56]
- Update the MIME types used by the server. [#51]
- Updated some dependencies. [#59]

## [0.16.6] - 2021-04-04

## [0.16.5] - 2021-03-29
### Fixed

  due to regression issues.

## [0.16.4] - 2021-03-28
### Added
- Allow to define a function as a `permalink` to generate it dynamically.
- The `permalink` value can have a relative path
  (must start with `./` or `../`) that will be resolved to the directory name.
- The `url` filter allows URLs starting with `~` to reference to source files
  that will be automatically resolved to the final URL.

### Fixed
- When reloading files on `lume --serve`,
  some ignored files weren’t correctly filtered.
- Improved `lume --serve` to only rebuild the site if it’s needed.
- Several changes for Windows compatibility.

## [0.16.3] - 2021-03-21

## [0.15.4] - 2021-03-08
### Added
- The `date` plugin accepts strings or integer arguments
  (they will be converted to a `Date` with the `new Date(value)` constructor).

### Fixed
- Updated dependencies.

## [0.15.0] - 2021-02-05
### Added
- New advanced search features:
  - You can filter by any field at any level, for example
    `search.pages("header.categories=my-category")`.

  when using different versions of plugins. [#35]
- Updated dependencies.
- Ensure the processors are executed in the same order they where defined.
- The `inline` plugin when the site is located in a subdirectory.

## [0.14.0] - 2021-02-02
### Changed
- API for the `Page` class:
  - Tags are stored as an array in `page.data.tags`
    (they were previously contained by a `Set` in `page.tags`).
  - Removed the `page.fullData` property. `page.data` contains the merged data.
