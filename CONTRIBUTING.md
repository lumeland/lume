# Contributing Guide

## How to contribute

This is a collaborative effort. We welcome all contributions submitted as pull
requests.

(Contributions on wording & style are also welcome.)

### Bugs

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful – thank you!

information about the environment – version of Lume, Deno, Operating System,
etc, and steps required to reproduce the issue.

### Pull Requests

Before create a pull request, please follow these instructions:

- One pull request per feature. If you want to do more than one thing, send
  multiple pull request.
- Write tests.
